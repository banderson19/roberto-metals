# Roberto Metals

A application to manage your scrap metal yard. 

## Description

This project was built to keep track of the metal that is purchased off clients. The daily tracker shows what client and the metal that was picked up from them, so it can all be tracked and kept record of. Future development will consist of paying out clients for the amount of metal we pick up from them.
